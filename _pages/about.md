Hello! Welcome to my academic portfolio. I'm Namhyun Kim, and I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Arizona State University. 

I'm passionate about advancing wireless communication technologies and exploring how artificial intelligence can revolutionize the way we design and optimize communication systems. My journey in this field has taken me from South Korea to Arizona, where I continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in wireless communications.

## Education

- **PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering** (In Progress)  
  Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ

- **M.S. in Electrical Engineering** (2023)  
  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), South Korea

- **B.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** (Hons., 2021)  
  Yonsei University, South Korea

## Professional Experience

- **Researcher** (2023)  
  SK Telecom Company Ltd., South Korea  
  *Gained hands-on experience in operating and optimizing 5G/LTE radio access networks (RAN)*

## Research Interests

My research focuses on several exciting areas that are shaping the future of wireless communications:

- **Massive MIMO Communications**: Exploring how to maximize the potential of large antenna arrays for better performance and efficiency
- **Multiple Access Technologies**: Developing innovative ways for multiple users to share wireless resources effectively
- **AI/ML-based Wireless Communications**: Harnessing the power of machine learning to solve complex communication challenges
- **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)**: Pioneering the convergence of sensing and communication capabilities in next-generation systems

## What I'm Working On

I'm particularly excited about my recent work on rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) techniques for massive MIMO systems and integrated sensing and communications. These technologies have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and capabilities of future wireless networks.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing research, collaboration opportunities, or simply connecting with fellow researchers and professionals in the field. Please don't hesitate to reach out!
