Hi there! I'm Namhyun Kim, and I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Arizona State University. 

I work on next-generation wireless networks and how AI can rethink their design and optimization. That path led me from South Korea to Arizona, where I keep exploring what's possible with these systems. I'm advised by [Prof. Ahmed Alkhateeb](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dLHw2qcAAAAJ&hl=en), and before ASU I worked as a network engineer at [SK Telecom](https://www.sktelecom.com/index_en.html), collaborating closely with [Prof. Jeonghun Park](https://yonsei-jpark.github.io/) and [Prof. Junil Choi](https://www.icl.kaist.ac.kr/people/professor).

## Education

- **PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering** (In Progress)  
  [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), Tempe, AZ

- **M.S. in Electrical Engineering** (2023)  
  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ([KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/)), Daejeon, South Korea

- **B.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** (Hons., 2021 — graduated in the top 3% of the class)  
  [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.do), Seoul, South Korea

## Professional Experience

- **Network Engineer** (2022–2023)  
  [SK Telecom](https://www.sktelecom.com/index_en.html), South Korea  
  *Gained hands-on experience in operating and optimizing 5G/LTE cellular radio access networks (RAN), including LTE/5G L1/L2/L3 network planning, engineering, troubleshooting, and performance analysis. Skilled with Python, SQL, and Kubernetes.*

## Research Interests

I explore a wide range of wireless communication challenges—from physical-layer signal processing to AI-augmented network intelligence. Visit the [Research Interests](/research/) page for a deeper dive into current themes.

## Scholarships

- **Korean Government Scholarship Program (KGSP)** — [NIIED, Republic of Korea Government](https://www.studyinkorea.go.kr/en/sub/gks/allnew_invite.do): A prestigious national scholarship providing funding support for two years to pursue graduate studies abroad.

## Publications
