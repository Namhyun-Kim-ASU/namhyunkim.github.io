Hi there! I'm Namhyun Kim, and I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Arizona State University. 

I focus on modern wireless networks and how AI can reshape their design and optimization. That path took me from South Korea to Arizona, where I keep pushing what these systems can do.

## Education

- **PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering** (In Progress)  
  [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), Tempe, AZ

- **M.S. in Electrical Engineering** (2023)  
  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ([KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/)), Daejeon, South Korea

- **B.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** (Hons., 2021 — graduated in the top 3% of the class)  
  [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.do), Seoul, South Korea

## Professional Experience

- **Network Engineer** (2023)  
  [SK Telecom](https://www.sktelecom.com/index_en.html), South Korea  
  *Gained hands-on experience in operating and optimizing 5G/LTE cellular radio access networks (RAN), including LTE/5G L1/L2/L3 network planning, engineering, troubleshooting, and performance analysis. Skilled with Python, SQL, and Kubernetes.*

## Research Interests

My work spans massive MIMO, rate-splitting multiple access, and integrated sensing and communications. Visit the [Research Interests](/research/) page for a deeper dive into current themes.

## Scholarships

- **Korean Government Scholarship Program (KGSP)** — [NIIED, Republic of Korea Government](https://www.studyinkorea.go.kr/en/sub/gks/allnew_invite.do): A prestigious national scholarship providing funding support for two years to pursue graduate studies abroad.

## Publications

- **Splitting Messages in the Dark – Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for FDD Massive MIMO Without CSI Feedback** — Accepted, *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications* (Aug. 2025)
- **Integrated Sensing and Communications in Downlink FDD MIMO without CSI Feedback** — Accepted, *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications* (Aug. 2025)
