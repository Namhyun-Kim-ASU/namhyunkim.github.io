Understanding and optimizing wireless networks is at the core of my research. I explore theory-driven approaches that stay close to real-world implementations, with a particular focus on the intersection between communications and machine learning.

## Focus Areas

- **Massive MIMO Communications**  
  Designing scalable transceiver architectures that extract the full potential of large antenna arrays under realistic hardware and channel constraints.

- **Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)**  
  Developing resilient multi-user transmission strategies that balance spectral efficiency and reliability without heavy channel-feedback overhead.

- **AI/ML-Driven Wireless Optimization**  
  Leveraging model-augmented machine learning to guide adaptive resource allocation, beamforming, and interference mitigation across diverse network scenarios.

- **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)**  
  Building joint sensing-and-communication frameworks that enable mobile platforms to perceive their environment while maintaining robust connectivity.

## Current Directions

- CSI-free downlink FDD frameworks that blend statistical estimation with RSMA to simplify deployment in dense cellular systems.
- Sensing-aware precoder design tailored for mmWave and sub-THz systems where bandwidth, latency, and situational awareness must be optimized simultaneously.
- Edge-intelligent coordination schemes that couple federated learning with radio access decisions for highly dynamic connected environments.
