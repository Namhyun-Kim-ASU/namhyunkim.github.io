Understanding and optimizing wireless networks is at the core of my research. I explore theory-driven approaches that stay close to real-world implementations, with a particular focus on the intersection between communications and machine learning.

## Focus Areas

- **Foundation Models for Wireless Communications**  
  Building large-scale neural representations of spectrum and channel behavior that transfer across bands, hardware, and deployment scenariosâ€”enabling few-shot adaptation for tasks like signal classification, interference detection, and beam management.

- **Massive MIMO Communications**  
  Designing scalable transceiver architectures that extract the full potential of large antenna arrays under realistic hardware and channel constraints.

- **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)**  
  Building joint sensing-and-communication frameworks that enable mobile platforms to perceive their environment while maintaining robust connectivity.

## Current Directions

- **Spectrum foundation models (LWM-Spectro)**  
  Training generative models on heterogeneous spectrum captures to uncover reusable neural priors, then adapting them to downstream spectrum sensing and interference diagnostics with minimal labeled data.
