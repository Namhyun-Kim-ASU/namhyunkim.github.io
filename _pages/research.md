Understanding and optimizing wireless networks is at the core of my research. I explore theory-driven approaches that stay close to real-world implementations, with a particular focus on the intersection between communications and machine learning.

## Focus Areas

- **Foundation Models for Wireless Communications**  
  Building large-scale neural representations of spectrum and channel behavior that transfer across bands, hardware, and deployment scenariosâ€”enabling few-shot adaptation for tasks like signal classification, interference detection, and beam management.

- **Massive MIMO Communications**  
  Designing scalable transceiver architectures that extract the full potential of large antenna arrays under realistic hardware and channel constraints.

- **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)**  
  Building joint sensing-and-communication frameworks that enable mobile platforms to perceive their environment while maintaining robust connectivity.

## Current Directions

- CSI-free downlink FDD frameworks that blend statistical estimation with RSMA to simplify deployment in dense cellular systems.
- Sensing-aware precoder design tailored for mmWave and sub-THz systems where bandwidth, latency, and situational awareness must be optimized simultaneously.
- Edge-intelligent coordination schemes that couple federated learning with radio access decisions for highly dynamic connected environments.
